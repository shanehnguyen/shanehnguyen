## Welcome 👋

If you’re new here, start with these:

### 🧠 CPU
➡️ **Pipelined RISC CPU (Verilog)**
- 5-stage pipeline  
- Data forwarding, load-use stalling, branch flush  
- Built + debugged at the cycle level  

### 🧩 Cache
➡️ **MESI Cache Coherence Simulator**
- Multi-core, bus-based coherence
- Handles races, invalidations, writebacks
- Stress-tested beyond “happy path” cases

---

I work mostly on **computer architecture, embedded systems, and hardware-adjacent software**.  
I care about performance, correctness, and understanding things *below* the abstraction.

If it touches cycles, memory, or electrons — I’m probably interested.
